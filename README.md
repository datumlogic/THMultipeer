THMultipeer
===========
THMultpeer is a wrapper on top of Apple iOS Multipeer Connectivity framework. It provides an easier way to create and manage sessions. It will save you time for handling disconnection and already has a mechanism to identify peers by setting displayName to be the device identifierForVendor (UUID String). Thus there will be no conflict if two devices having the same name.
